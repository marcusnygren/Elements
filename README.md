Elements
================================

Project in the course TNG022 Modelling and Simulation at Link√∂ping University.

Aim for the project
-------------------------
Using the Navier-Stokes equations to develop a system for visualizing different fluids, e.g. smoke. In the application you should be able to modify the parameter values to see how changing the equation affects the simulation in real-time.

Result
-------------------------
A system that currently can visualize smoke with different density values in 2D (calculations done in 3D, but no volume renderer written during this course), also allowing the user to change the position of the point source via the WASD keys.
